SQL is used for descriptive analysis, while Python is required for predictive modeling.\n\n\n\nComposite Digital Well‑being Index (DWI): designed to capture the overall digital well‑being of a user.\nIt combines several dimensions of digital and personal life:\n- Screen time (daily_screen_time_min) → higher screen time reduces the score, since excessive use is considered negative.\n- Negative interactions (negative_interactions_count) → more negative interactions lower the score.\n- Sleep hours (sleep_hours) → sufficient sleep increases the score.\n- Physical activity (physical_activity_min) → higher levels of physical activity increase the score.\n\n- Values close to 0 → low digital well‑being (heavy screen use, little sleep, low activity, many negative interactions).\n- Values close to 1 → high digital well‑being (balanced usage, sufficient sleep, regular physical activity, few negative interactions).\n'''\n\n#Average wellbeing index by age group and gender\nSELECT\n    CASE\n        WHEN age BETWEEN 18 AND 25 THEN '18–25'\n        WHEN age BETWEEN 26 AND 35 THEN '26–35'\n        WHEN age BETWEEN 36 AND 50 THEN '36–50'\n        ELSE '51+'\n    END AS age_group,\n    gender,\n    AVG(\n        (\n            (daily_screen_time_min / 600.0 * -1) +\n            (negative_interactions_count / 10.0 * -1) +\n            (sleep_hours / 9.0) +\n            (physical_activity_min / 60.0)\n        ) / 4\n    ) AS wellbeing_index,\n    COUNT(*) AS user_count\nFROM mental_health_social_media_correct\nGROUP BY age_group, gender\nORDER BY age_group, gender;\n\n#Findings:\n'''Age effect dominates: The youngest group (18–25) has the poorest digital well‑being, while mid‑adults (36–50) show the healthiest balance.\nGender differences are minimal: Within each age group, Female, Male, and Other categories have very similar scores.\nOlder adults (51+) remain relatively positive, though not as high as the 36–50 group.\nThis suggests that age is the primary driver of digital well‑being, while gender plays only a minor role.\n'''\n\n# What are the main predictive factors of mental_state?\n'''We apply an explanatory model—specifically a multinomial logistic regression—that allows us to evaluate how behavioral and demographic factors influence the \nprobability of belonging to one of the categories (Healthy, At_Risk, or Stressed). This approach highlights which factors make each mental state more probable \naccording to the model and provides insights into the strongest predictors of digital well‑being.\n'''\n\n# Why use Python\n'''\nThe analysis of predictive factors for mental_state could not be implemented directly in SQL. \nInstead, Python was used with libraries such as pandas and scikit‑learn, which provide the necessary tools \nto build explanatory models, train and test them, and interpret the coefficients. \nThis allowed us to identify which variables make each mental state more probable according to the model.\n'''\n\n# Import libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\n\n# Load the dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/mental-health-social-media-correct/mental_health_social_media_correct.csv\")\n\n# Select explanatory variables\nX = df[[\n    \"daily_screen_time_min\",        #

Platform choice also plays a role, with fast‑paced social media \nenvironments associated with stress. Overall, the results highlight the importance of balanced digital habits and lifestyle factors in promoting healthier mental states.\n'''","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
